#If using AAF for Role based authentication/authorization, define your routes/services which will utilize AAF. The AJSC will
#read this file and protect the routes given with the AAF role defined.

#The following example would protect the JAXRS echo example service provided with the archetype.
#/services/${namespace}/v1/jaxrs-services/jaxrsExample/echo/*=com.att.ajsc.myper|mymachine|manage

#The following example would protect ALL AJSC services running within your project.
#/**=com.att.ajsc.myperm|mymachine|manage

#The following example would protect ALL REST services utilizing the Camel restlet routes.
#/rest/**=com.att.ajsc.myperm|mymachine|manage
